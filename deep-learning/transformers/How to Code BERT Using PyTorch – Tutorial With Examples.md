If you are an NLP enthusiast then you might have heard about BERT. In this article, we are going to explore BERT: what it is? and how it works?, and learn how to code it using PyTorch.

In 2018, Google published a paper titled ‚Äú[Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)‚Äù. In this paper, they introduced a language model called **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation with Transformers)** that achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks like *Question-Answering*, *Natural Language Inference, Classification, and General language understanding evaluation or (GLUE)*.

BERT release was followed after the release of three architectures that also achieved state-of-the-art performances. These models were:

- ULM-Fit (January)
- ELMo (February),
- OpenAI GPT (June)
- BERT (October).

The OpenAI GPT and BERT use the [**Transformer**](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf) architecture that does not use recurrent neural networks; this enabled the architecture to take into account long-term dependencies through the **self-attention mechanism** that inherently changed the way we model sequential data. It introduced an **encoder-decoder** architecture which was seen in computer vision applications such as image generation through variational autoencoder encoder.

So how is BERT different from all the models that were released in 2018?

Well, to answer that question we need to understand what BERT is and how it works.

So, let‚Äôs begin.

## What is BERT?

BERT stands for ‚ÄúBidirectional Encoder Representation with Transformers‚Äù. To put it in simple words BERT extracts patterns or representations from the data or word embeddings by passing it through an encoder. The encoder itself is a transformer architecture that is stacked together. It is a bidirectional transformer which means that during training it considers the context from both left and right of the vocabulary to extract patterns or representations.

![BERT encoder](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-encoder.png?resize=321%2C413&ssl=1)[*Source*](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)

BERT uses two training paradigms: **Pre-training** and **Fine-tuning**.

During **pre-training,** the model is trained on a large dataset to extract patterns. This is generally an **unsupervised learning** task where the model is trained on an unlabelled dataset like the data from a big corpus like Wikipedia.

During **fine-tuning** the model is trained for downstream tasks like Classification, Text-Generation, Language Translation, Question-Answering, and so forth. Essentially, you can download a pre-trained model and then Transfer-learn the model on your data.

### Core components of BERT

BERT borrows ideas from the previous release SOTA models. Let‚Äôs elaborate on that statement.

#### The Transformers

BERT‚Äôs main component is the transformer architecture. The transformers are made up of two components: **encoder** and **decoder**. The encoder itself contains two components: the **self-attention layer** and **feed-forward neural network**.

The self-attention layer takes an input and encodes each word into intermediate encoded representations which are then passed through the feed-forward neural network. The feed-forward network passes those representations to the decoder that itself is made up of three components: **self-attention layer, Encoder-Decoder** **Attention,** and **feed-forward neural network**.

![BERT components](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-components.png?resize=1024%2C382&ssl=1)*[Source](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)*

The benefit of the transformer architecture is that it helps the model to retain infinitely long sequences that were not possible from the traditional RNNs, LSTMs, and GRU. But even from the fact that it can achieve long-term dependencies it still **lacks contextual understanding**.

*Jay Alammar explains transformers in-depth in his article* [*The Illustrated Transformer*](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)*, worth checking out.*

#### ELMo

BERT borrows another idea from ELMo which stands for Embeddings from Language Model. ELMo was introduced by [Peters et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365) in 2017 which dealt with the idea of contextual understanding. The way ELMo works is that it uses **bidirectional** LSTM to make sense of the context. Since it considers words from both directions, it can assign different word embedding to words that are spelled similarly but have different meanings.

For instance, ‚ÄúYou kids should **stick** together in the dark‚Äù is completely different from ‚ÄúHand me that **stick**‚Äù. Even though the same word is being used in both sentences the meaning is different based on the context.

So, ELMo assigns embeddings by considering the words from both the right and left directions as compared to the models that were developed previously which took into consideration words, only from the left. These models were unidirectional like RNNs, LSTMs et cetera.

This enables ELMo to capture contextual information from the sequences but since ELMo uses LTSM it does not have long-term dependency compared to transformers.

So far we have seen that BERT can access sequences in the document even if it is ‚Äòn‚Äô words behind the current word in the sequence because of the attention mechanism present in transformers, i.e. it can preserve long term dependencies and it can also achieve a contextual understanding of the sentence because of the bidirectional mechanism present in ELMo.

#### ULM-FiT

In 2018 Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder released a paper called [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning or ULM-FiT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf), where they argued that transfer learning can be used in NLP just like it is used in computer vision.

Previously we were using pre-trained models for word-embeddings that only targeted the first layer of the entire model, i.e. the embedding layers, and the whole model was trained from the scratch, this was time-consuming, and not a lot of success was found in this area. However, Howard and Ruder proposed 3 methods for the classification of text:

- The first step includes training the model on a larger dataset so that the model learns representations.
- The second step included fine-tuning the model with a task-specific dataset for classification, during which they introduced two more methods: Discriminative fine-tuning and Slanted triangular learning rates (STLR). The former method tries to fine-tune or optimize the parameters for each during the transfer layer in the network while the latter controls the learning rate in each of the optimization steps.
- The third step was to fine-tune the classifier on the task-specific dataset for classification.

![BERT ULM-FiT](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-ULM-FiT.png?resize=1024%2C483&ssl=1)*[Source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf)*

With the release of ULM-FiT NLP practitioners can now practice the transfer learning approach in their NLP problems. But the only problem with the ULM-FiT approach to transfer learning was that it included fine-tuning all the layers in the network which was a lot of work.

#### OpenAI GPT

Generative Pre-trained Transformer or GPT was introduced by OpenAI‚Äôs team: Radford, Narasimhan, Salimans, and Sutskever. They presented a model that only uses decoders from the transformer instead of encoders in a unidirectional approach. As a result, it outperformed all the previous models in various tasks like:

- Classification
- Natural Language Inference
- Semantic similarity
- Question answering
- Multiple Choice.

Even though the GPT used only the decoder, it could still retain long-term dependencies. Furthermore, it reduced fine-tuning to a minimum compared to what we saw in ULM-FiT.

Below is the table that compares different models based upon pre-training, downstream tasks, and most importantly fine-tuning.

![Language models comparison](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Language-models-comparison.png?resize=840%2C474&ssl=1)*[Source](https://medium.com/@gauravghati/comparison-between-bert-gpt-2-and-elmo-9ad140cd1cda)*

An excerpt from the GPT [paper](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) reads ‚Äú*This model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in text, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across diverse tasks. During the transfer, we utilize task-specific input adaptations derived from traversal-style approaches, which process structured text input as a single contiguous sequence of tokens. As we demonstrate in our experiments, these adaptations enable us to fine-tune effectively with minimal changes to the architecture of the pre-trained model.*‚Äù

## Why BERT?

BERT falls into a self-supervised model. That means, it can generate inputs and labels from the raw corpus without being explicitly programmed by humans. Remember the data it is trained on is unstructured.

BERT was pre-trained with two specific tasks: Masked Language Model and Next sentence prediction. The former uses masked input like ‚Äúthe man [MASK] to the store‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthe man went to the store‚Äù. This restricts BERT to see the words next to it which allows it to learn bidirectional representations as much as possible making it much more flexible and reliable for several downstream tasks. The latter predicts whether the two sentences are contextually assigned to each other.

![BERT masking](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-masking-1.png?resize=840%2C571&ssl=1)*[Source](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)*

For instance, if sentence A is ‚Äú[CLS] the man [MASK] to the store‚Äù and sentence B is ‚Äúpenguin [MASK] are flightless birds [SEP]‚Äù, then BERT will be able to classify whether both the sentences are continuous or not.

During the training, BERT uses special types of tokens like [CLS], [MASK], [SEP] et cetera, that allow BERT to distinguish when a sentence begins, which word is masked, and when two sentences are separated. I have explained these tokens in tabular format in the **preprocessing** section.

**BERT can also be used for feature extraction** because of the properties we discussed previously and feed these extractions to your existing model.

![BERT feature extraction](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-feature-extraction-1024x706.png?resize=840%2C579&ssl=1)*[Source](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)*

In the original BERT paper, it was compared with GPT on the [General Language understanding evaluation benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/), and here are the results.

![BERT GPT comparison](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-GPT-comparison.png?resize=1024%2C247&ssl=1)[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)

As you can see BERT outperformed GPT in all the tasks and averages 7% better than GPT.

## Coding BERT with Pytorch

Let‚Äôs understand with code how to build BERT with PyTorch.

We will break the entire program into 4 sections:

1. Preprocessing
2. Building model
3. Loss and Optimization
4. Training

### CHECK ALSO

### Preprocessing

In preprocessing we will structure the data such that the neural network can process it. We start by assigning a raw text for training.

```
text = (
       'Hello, how are you? I am Romeo.\n'
       'Hello, Romeo My name is Juliet. Nice to meet you.\n'
       'Nice meet you too. How are you today?\n'
       'Great. My baseball team won the competition.\n'
       'Oh Congratulations, Juliet\n'
       'Thanks you Romeo'
   )
```

Then we will clean the data by:

- Making the sentences into lower case.
- Creating vocabulary. **Vocabulary** is a list of unique words in the document.

```
  sentences = re.sub("[.,!?\\-]", '', text.lower()).split('\n')  # filter '.', ',', '?', '!'
   word_list = list(set(" ".join(sentences).split()))
```

Now, in the following step, it is important to remember that BERT takes special tokens during training. Here is a table explaining the purpose of various tokens:

Token

Purpose

[CLS]

The first token is always classification

[SEP]

Separates two sentences

[END]

End the sentence.

[PAD]

Use to truncate the sentence with equal length.

[MASK]

Use to create a mask by replacing the original word.

These tokens should be included in the word dictionary where each token and word in the vocabulary is assigned with an index number.

```
word_dict = {'[PAD]': 0, '[CLS]': 1, '[SEP]': 2, '[MASK]': 3}
for i, w in enumerate(word_list):
   word_dict[w] = i + 4
   number_dict = {i: w for i, w in enumerate(word_dict)}
   vocab_size = len(word_dict)
```

Once that is taken care of, we need to create a function that formats the input sequences for three types of embeddings: **token embedding**, **segment embedding,** and **position embedding**.

What is token embedding?

For instance, if the sentence is ‚ÄúThe cat is walking. The dog is barking‚Äù, then the function should create a sequence in the following manner: ‚Äú[CLS] the cat is walking [SEP] the dog is barking‚Äù.

After that, we convert everything to an index from the word dictionary. So the previous sentence would look something like ‚Äú[1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11]‚Äù. Keep in mind that 1 and 2 are [CLS] and [SEP] respectively.

**What is segment embedding?**

A segment embedding separates two sentences from each other and they are generally defined as 0 and 1.

**What is position embedding?**

A position embedding gives position to each embedding in a sequence.

We will create a function for position embedding later.

![BERT embeddings](https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/BERT-embeddings-1024x340.png?resize=1024%2C340&ssl=1)[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)

Now the next step will be to create **masking**.

As mentioned in the original paper, BERT randomly assigns masks to 15% of the sequence. But keep in mind that you don‚Äôt assign masks to the special tokens. For that, we will use conditional statements.

Once we replace 15% of the words with [MASK] tokens, we will add padding. Padding is usually done to make sure that all the sentences are of equal length. For instance, if we take the sentence :

 ***‚ÄúThe cat is walking. The dog is barking at the tree‚Äù***

then with padding, it will look like this:

***‚Äú[CLS] The cat is walking [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]. [CLS] The dog is barking at the tree.‚Äù***

The length of the first sentence is equal to the length of the second sentence.

```
def make_batch():
   batch = []
   positive = negative = 0
   while positive != batch_size/2 or negative != batch_size/2:
       tokens_a_index, tokens_b_index= randrange(len(sentences)), randrange(len(sentences))

       tokens_a, tokens_b= token_list[tokens_a_index], token_list[tokens_b_index]

       input_ids = [word_dict['[CLS]']] + tokens_a + [word_dict['[SEP]']] + tokens_b + [word_dict['[SEP]']]


       segment_ids = [0] * (1 + len(tokens_a) + 1) + [1] * (len(tokens_b) + 1)

       # MASK LM
       n_pred =  min(max_pred, max(1, int(round(len(input_ids) * 0.15)))) # 15 % of tokens in one sentence
       cand_maked_pos = [i for i, token in enumerate(input_ids)
                         if token != word_dict['[CLS]'] and token != word_dict['[SEP]']]
       shuffle(cand_maked_pos)
       masked_tokens, masked_pos = [], []
       for pos in cand_maked_pos[:n_pred]:
           masked_pos.append(pos)
           masked_tokens.append(input_ids[pos])
           if random() < 0.8:  # 80%
               input_ids[pos] = word_dict['[MASK]'] # make mask
           elif random() < 0.5:  # 10%
               index = randint(0, vocab_size - 1) # random index in vocabulary
               input_ids[pos] = word_dict[number_dict[index]] # replace

       # Zero Paddings
       n_pad = maxlen - len(input_ids)
       input_ids.extend([0] * n_pad)
       segment_ids.extend([0] * n_pad)

       # Zero Padding (100% - 15%) tokens
       if max_pred > n_pred:
           n_pad = max_pred - n_pred
           masked_tokens.extend([0] * n_pad)
           masked_pos.extend([0] * n_pad)

       if tokens_a_index + 1 == tokens_b_index and positive < batch_size/2:
           batch.append([input_ids, segment_ids, masked_tokens, masked_pos, True]) # IsNext
           positive += 1
       elif tokens_a_index + 1 != tokens_b_index and negative < batch_size/2:
           batch.append([input_ids, segment_ids, masked_tokens, masked_pos, False]) # NotNext
           negative += 1
   return batch
```

Since we are dealing with next-word prediction, we have to create a label that predicts whether the sentence has a consecutive sentence or not, i.e. IsNext or NotNext. So we assign True for every sentence that precedes the next sentence and we use a conditional statement to do that.

For instance, two sentences in a document usually follow each other if they are in context. So assuming the first sentence is A then the next sentence should be A+1. Intuitively we write the code such that if the first sentence positions i.e. tokens_a_index + 1 == tokens_b_index, i.e. second sentence in the same context, then we can set the label for this input as True.

If the above condition is not met i.e. if tokens_a_index + 1 != tokens_b_index then we set the label for this input as False.

### Building model

BERT is a complex model and if it is perceived slowly you lose track of the logic. So it‚Äôll only make sense to explain its component by component and their function.

BERT has the following components:

1. Embedding layers
2. Attention Mask
3. Encoder layer
   1. Multi-head attention
      1. Scaled dot product attention
   2. Position-wise feed-forward network
4. BERT (assembling all the components)

To make learning easier you can always refer to this diagram.

#### Embedding layer

The embedding is the first layer in BERT that takes the input and creates a *lookup table*. The parameters of the embedding layers are learnable, which means when the learning process is over the embeddings will cluster similar words together.

The embedding layer also preserves different relationships between words such as: semantic, syntactic, linear, and since BERT is bidirectional it will also preserve contextual relationships as well.

In the case of BERT, it creates three embeddings for

- Token,
- Segments and
- Position.

If you recall we haven‚Äôt created a function that takes the input and formats it for position embedding but the formatting for token and segments are completed. So we will take the input and create a position for each word in the sequence. And it looks something like this:

```
print(torch.arange(30, dtype=torch.long).expand_as(input_ids))
Output:

tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
        [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
        [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
        [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
        [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
        [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
         18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]])
```

In the forward function, we sum up all the embeddings and normalize them.

#### Creating attention mask

[BERT needs attention masks](https://neptune.ai/blog/unmasking-bert-transformer-model-performance). And these should be in a proper format. The following code will help you create masks.

It will convert the [PAD] to 1 and elsewhere 0.

```
def get_attn_pad_mask(seq_q, seq_k):
   batch_size, len_q = seq_q.size()
   batch_size, len_k = seq_k.size()
   # eq(zero) is PAD token
   pad_attn_mask = seq_k.data.eq(0).unsqueeze(1)  # batch_size x 1 x len_k(=len_q), one is masking
   return pad_attn_mask.expand(batch_size, len_q, len_k)  # batch_size x len_q x len_k
print(get_attn_pad_mask(input_ids, input_ids)[0][0], input_ids[0])
Output:
(tensor([False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False,
         False, False, False,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,
          True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True,  True]),
 tensor([ 1,  3, 26, 21, 14, 16, 12,  4,  2, 27,  3, 22,  2,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
          0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]))
```

#### Encoder

The encoder has two main components:

- Multi-head Attention
- Position-wise feed-forward network.

The work of the encoder is to find representations and patterns from the input and attention mask.

```
class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self):
       super(EncoderLayer, self).__init__()
       self.enc_self_attn = MultiHeadAttention()
       self.pos_ffn = PoswiseFeedForwardNet()

   def forward(self, enc_inputs, enc_self_attn_mask):
       enc_outputs, attn = self.enc_self_attn(enc_inputs, enc_inputs, enc_inputs, enc_self_attn_mask) # enc_inputs to same Q,K,V
       enc_outputs = self.pos_ffn(enc_outputs) # enc_outputs: [batch_size x len_q x d_model]
       return enc_outputs, attn
```

**Multi-head attention**

This is the first of the main components of the encoder.

The attention model takes three inputs: **Query**, **Key,** and **Value**.

*I highly recommend you to read* [*The Illustrated Transformer*](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) *by Jay Alammar that explains Attention models in depth.*

Multihead attention takes four inputs: **Query**, **Key**, **Value,** and **Attention mask**. The embeddings are fed as input to the Query, Key, and Value argument, and the attention mask is fed as input to the attention mask argument.
These three inputs and the attention mask are operated with a dot product operation that yields two outputs: **context vectors** and **attention**. The context vector is then passed through a linear layer and finally that yields the output.

```
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self):
       super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__()
       self.W_Q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_k * n_heads)
       self.W_K = nn.Linear(d_model, d_k * n_heads)
       self.W_V = nn.Linear(d_model, d_v * n_heads)

   def forward(self, Q, K, V, attn_mask):
       # q: [batch_size x len_q x d_model], k: [batch_size x len_k x d_model], v: [batch_size x len_k x d_model]
       residual, batch_size = Q, Q.size(0)
       # (B, S, D) -proj-> (B, S, D) -split-> (B, S, H, W) -trans-> (B, H, S, W)
       q_s = self.W_Q(Q).view(batch_size, -1, n_heads, d_k).transpose(1,2)  # q_s: [batch_size x n_heads x len_q x d_k]
       k_s = self.W_K(K).view(batch_size, -1, n_heads, d_k).transpose(1,2)  # k_s: [batch_size x n_heads x len_k x d_k]
       v_s = self.W_V(V).view(batch_size, -1, n_heads, d_v).transpose(1,2)  # v_s: [batch_size x n_heads x len_k x d_v]

       attn_mask = attn_mask.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, n_heads, 1, 1) # attn_mask : [batch_size x n_heads x len_q x len_k]

       # context: [batch_size x n_heads x len_q x d_v], attn: [batch_size x n_heads x len_q(=len_k) x len_k(=len_q)]
       context, attn = ScaledDotProductAttention()(q_s, k_s, v_s, attn_mask)
       context = context.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, n_heads * d_v) # context: [batch_size x len_q x n_heads * d_v]
       output = nn.Linear(n_heads * d_v, d_model)(context)


return nn.LayerNorm(d_model)(output + residual), attn # output: [batch_size x len_q x d_model]
```

Now, let‚Äôs explore this Scaled Dot Product attention:

- The scaled dot product attention class takes four arguments: Query, Key, Value, and Attention mask. Essentially, the first three arguments are fed with the word embeddings and the attention mask argument is fed with attention mask embeddings.
- Then it does a matrix multiplication between **query** and **key** to get scores.

Following that we use scores.masked_fill_(attn_mask, -1e9) . This attribute fills the element of scores with -1e9 where the attention masks are **True** while the rest of the elements get an **attention score** which is then passed through a softmax function that gives a score between 0 and 1. Finally, we perform a matrix multiplication between attention and values which gives us the context vectors.

```
class ScaledDotProductAttention(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self):
       super(ScaledDotProductAttention, self).__init__()

   def forward(self, Q, K, V, attn_mask):
       scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-1, -2)) / np.sqrt(d_k) # scores : [batch_size x n_heads x len_q(=len_k) x len_k(=len_q)]
       scores.masked_fill_(attn_mask, -1e9) # Fills elements of self tensor with value where mask is one.
       attn = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)(scores)
       context = torch.matmul(attn, V)
       return score, context, attn
emb = Embedding()
embeds = emb(input_ids, segment_ids)

attenM = get_attn_pad_mask(input_ids, input_ids)

SDPA= ScaledDotProductAttention()(embeds, embeds, embeds, attenM)

S, C, A = SDPA

print('Masks',masks[0][0])
print()
print('Scores: ', S[0][0],'\n\nAttention Scores after softmax: ', A[0][0])
Output:

**Position-Wise Feed Forward Network**

The output from the multihead goes into the feed-forward network and that concludes the encoder part.

Let‚Äôs take a breath and revise what we‚Äôve learned so far:

- The input goes into the embedding and as well attention function. Both of which are fed into the encoder which has a multi-head function and a feed-forward network.
- The multi-head function itself has a function that operates the embeddings and attention mask using a dot product operation.

#### Assembling all the components

Let‚Äôs continue from where we left, i.e. the output from the encoder.

The encoder yields two outputs:

- One which comes from the feed-forward layer and
- the Attention mask.

It‚Äôs key to remember that BERT does not explicitly use a decoder. Instead, it uses the output and the attention mask to get the desired result.

Although the decoder section in the transformers is replaced with a shallow network which can be used for classification as shown in the code below.
Also, BERT outputs two results: one for the **classifier** and the other for **masked**.

```
class BERT(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self):
       super(BERT, self).__init__()
       self.embedding = Embedding()
       self.layers = nn.ModuleList([EncoderLayer() for _ in range(n_layers)])
       self.fc = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
       self.activ1 = nn.Tanh()
       self.linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
       self.activ2 = gelu
       self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
       self.classifier = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)
       # decoder is shared with embedding layer
       embed_weight = self.embedding.tok_embed.weight
       n_vocab, n_dim = embed_weight.size()
       self.decoder = nn.Linear(n_dim, n_vocab, bias=False)
       self.decoder.weight = embed_weight
       self.decoder_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_vocab))

   def forward(self, input_ids, segment_ids, masked_pos):
       output = self.embedding(input_ids, segment_ids)
       enc_self_attn_mask = get_attn_pad_mask(input_ids, input_ids)
       for layer in self.layers:
           output, enc_self_attn = layer(output, enc_self_attn_mask)
       # output : [batch_size, len, d_model], attn : [batch_size, n_heads, d_mode, d_model]
       # it will be decided by first token(CLS)
       h_pooled = self.activ1(self.fc(output[:, 0])) # [batch_size, d_model]
       logits_clsf = self.classifier(h_pooled) # [batch_size, 2]

       masked_pos = masked_pos[:, :, None].expand(-1, -1, output.size(-1)) # [batch_size, max_pred, d_model]

       # get masked position from final output of transformer.
       h_masked = torch.gather(output, 1, masked_pos) # masking position [batch_size, max_pred, d_model]
       h_masked = self.norm(self.activ2(self.linear(h_masked)))
       logits_lm = self.decoder(h_masked) + self.decoder_bias # [batch_size, max_pred, n_vocab]

       return logits_lm, logits_clsf
```

Few things to keep in mind:

1. You can assign the number of encoders. In the original paper, the base model has 12.
2. There are two activation functions: Tanh and GELU(**G**aussian **E**rror **L**inear **U**nit).

```
def gelu(x):
   return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x / math.sqrt(2.0)))
```

### Loss and optimization

Although the original paper calculates the probability distribution over all the vocabulary, we can use a softmax approximation. But a neat way to do it is to use ***cross-entropy loss\***. It‚Äôs a combination of both *softmax* and *negative log-likelihood*.

So while building the model you don‚Äôt have to include softmax instead get a clean output from feed-forward neural nets without softmax normalization.

When it comes to optimization we will be using **Adam** optimizer.

```
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

### Training

Finally, we‚Äôll start the training.

```
model = BERT()
batch = make_batch()
input_ids, segment_ids, masked_tokens, masked_pos, isNext = map(torch.LongTensor, zip(*batch))

   for epoch in range(100):
       optimizer.zero_grad()
       logits_lm, logits_clsf = model(input_ids, segment_ids, masked_pos)
       loss_lm = criterion(logits_lm.transpose(1, 2), masked_tokens) # for masked LM
       loss_lm = (loss_lm.float()).mean()
       loss_clsf = criterion(logits_clsf, isNext) # for sentence classification
       loss = loss_lm + loss_clsf
       if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
           print('Epoch:', '%04d' % (epoch + 1), 'cost =', '{:.6f}'.format(loss))
       loss.backward()
       optimizer.step()

   # Predict mask tokens
   input_ids, segment_ids, masked_tokens, masked_pos, isNext = map(torch.LongTensor, zip(batch[0]))
   print(text)
   print([number_dict[w.item()] for w in input_ids[0] if number_dict[w.item()] != '[PAD]'])

   logits_lm, logits_clsf = model(input_ids, segment_ids, masked_pos)
   logits_lm = logits_lm.data.max(2)[1][0].data.numpy()
   print('masked tokens list : ',[pos.item() for pos in masked_tokens[0] if pos.item() != 0])
   print('predict masked tokens list : ',[pos for pos in logits_lm if pos != 0])

   logits_clsf = logits_clsf.data.max(1)[1].data.numpy()[0]
   print('isNext : ', True if isNext else False)
   print('predict isNext : ',True if logits_clsf else False)
Output:

Hello, how are you? I am Romeo.
Hello, Romeo My name is Juliet. Nice to meet you.
Nice meet you too. How are you today?
Great. My baseball team won the competition.
Oh Congratulations, Juliet
Thanks you Romeo
['[CLS]', 'nice', 'meet', 'you', 'too', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'today', '[SEP]', '[MASK]', 'congratulations', '[MASK]', '[SEP]']
masked tokens list :  [27, 22]
predict masked tokens list :  []
isNext :  False
predict isNext :  True
```

So that was BERT coding from scratch. If you train it over a large corpus you then you can use the same model for:

1. Pretraining: use any corpus but with the exact format of input representation as mentioned before.
2. Fine-tuning: make sure that you use supervised learning data for it.
3. Feature extractor for different tasks, or even topic modeling.

You can find the complete notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13FjI_uXaw8JJGjzjVX3qKSLyW9p3b6OV?usp=sharing).

## Is there a way to get a pre-trained model?

In the original paper, two models were released: BERT-base, and BERT-large. In the article, I showed how you can code BERT from scratch.

Generally, you can download the pre-trained model so that you don‚Äôt have to go through these steps. The [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) ![ü§ó](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/svg/1f917.svg) library offers this feature you can use the transformer library from Huggingface for PyTorch. The process remains the same.

I have a notebook where I used a pre-trained BERT from Huggingface, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/Nielspace/BERT/blob/master/BERT Text Classification fine-tuning.ipynb).

When you use a pre-trained model, all you need to do is download the model and then call it inside a class and use a forward method to feed your inputs and masks.

For instance:

```
import transformers

class BERTClassification(nn.Module):
    def __init__ (self):
        super(BERTClassification, self).__init__()
        self.bert = transformers.BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')
        self.bert_drop = nn.Dropout(0.4)
        self.out = nn.Linear(768, 1)

    def forward(self, ids, mask, token_type_ids):
        _, pooledOut = self.bert(ids, attention_mask = mask,
                                token_type_ids=token_type_ids)
        bertOut = self.bert_drop(pooledOut)
        output = self.out(bertOut)

        return output
```

## Final thoughts

BERT is a very powerful state-of-the-art NLP model. The pre-trained model is trained on a large corpus and you can fine-tune it according to your needs and based on the task on a smaller dataset. The best thing about fine-tuning is that you don‚Äôt do it for 1000 epochs, it can mimic SOTA performances even in 3 to 10 epochs depending on the parameters and how well the dataset is processed.

I hope this tutorial was interesting and informative. And I hope you were able to take something out of it.

## 10 Things You Need to Know About BERT and the Transformer Architecture That Are Reshaping the AI Landscape

25 mins read | Author Cathal Horan | Updated May 31st, 2021

Few areas of AI are more exciting than NLP right now. In recent years language models (LM), which can perform human-like linguistic tasks, have evolved to perform better than anyone could have expected.

In fact, they‚Äôre performing so well that [people are wondering](https://neptune.ai/blog/ai-limits-can-deep-learning-models-like-bert-ever-understand-language) whether they‚Äôre reaching a level of [general intelligence](https://chatbotslife.com/is-gpt-3-the-first-artificial-general-intelligence-a7390dca155f), or the evaluation metrics we use to test them just can‚Äôt keep up. When technology like this comes along, whether it is electricity, the railway, the internet or the iPhone, one thing is clear ‚Äì you can‚Äôt ignore it. It will end up impacting every part of the modern world.

It‚Äôs important to learn about technologies like this, because then you can use them to your advantage. So, let‚Äôs learn!

We will cover ten things to show you where this technology came from, how it was developed, how it works, and what to expect from it in the near future. The ten things are:

1. **What is BERT and the transformer, and why do I need to understand it?** Models like BERT are already massively impacting academia and business, so we‚Äôll outline some of the ways these models are used, and clarify some of the terminology around them.
2. **What did we do before these models?** To understand these models, it‚Äôs important to look at the problems in this area and understand how we tackled them before models like BERT came on the scene. This way we can understand the limits of previous models and better appreciate the motivation behind the key design aspects of the Transformer architecture, which underpins most SOTA models like BERT.
3. **NLPs ‚ÄúImageNet moment; pre-trained models:** Originally, we all trained our own models, or you had to fully train a model for a specific task. One of the key milestones which enabled the rapid evolution in performance was the creation of pre-trained models which could be used ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù and tuned to your specific task with little effort and data, in a process known as transfer learning. Understanding this is key to seeing why these models have been, and continue to perform well in a range of NLP tasks.
4. **Understanding the Transformer:** You‚Äôve probably heard of BERT and GPT-3, but what about [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/roberta.html), [ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/albert.html), [XLNet](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/xlnet.html), or the [LONGFORMER](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html), [REFORMER](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/reformer.html), or [T5 Transformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/t5.html)? The amount of new models seems overwhelming, but if you understand the Transformer architecture, you‚Äôll have a window into the internal workings of all of these models. It‚Äôs the same as when you understand RDBMS technology, giving you a good handle on software like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle. The relational model that underpins all of the DBs is the same as the Transformer architecture that underpins our models. Understand that, and RoBERTa or XLNet becomes just the difference between using MySQL or PostgreSQL. It still takes time to learn the nuances of each model, but you have a solid foundation and you‚Äôre not starting from scratch.
5. **The importance of bidirectionality**: As you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre not strictly reading from one side to the other. You‚Äôre not reading this sentence letter by letter in one direction from one side to the other. Instead, you‚Äôre jumping ahead and learning context from the words and letters ahead of where you are right now. It turns out this is a critical feature of the Transformer architecture. The Transformer architecture enables models to process text in a bidirectional manner, from start to finish and from finish to start. This has been central to the limits of previous models which could only process text from start to finish.
