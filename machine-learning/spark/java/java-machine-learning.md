# Java Tools for Deep Learning, Machine Learning and AI

Why should you use JVM languagues like Java, [Scala](https://wiki.pathmind.com/scala-ai), Clojure or Kotlin to build AI and machine-learning solutions?

Java is the [most widely used programming language in the world](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Large organizations in the public and private sector have enormous Java code bases, and rely heavily on the JVM as a compute environment. In particular, much of the open-source big data stack is written for the JVM. This includes [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) for distributed data management; [Apache Spark](https://wiki.pathmind.com/apache-spark-deep-learning) as a distributed run-time for fast ETL; [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a message queue; [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) and [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) for search; and [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) for data storage to name a few. The tools below give you powerful ways to leverage machine learning on the JVM.

Deep learning usually refers to deep artificial neural networks. [Neural networks](https://wiki.pathmind.com/neural-network) are a type of machine learning algorithm loosely modeled on the neurons in the human brain.

### TensorFlow-Java

[TensorFlow provides a Java API](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_java). While it is not as fully developed as TensorFlow’s Python API, progress is being made. Karl Lessard is leading efforts to adapt TensorFlow to the JVM. Those interested can join the TensorFlow Java SIG or this [Tensorflow JVM Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tensorflow/sig-jvm). [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments. [TensorFlow-Java’s Github repository can be found here](https://github.com/tensorflow/java/) and [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java). Companies such as Facebook are active on the TensorFlow SIG led by [Karl Lessard](https://github.com/karllessard).

### Neuroph

[Neuroph](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source Java framework for neural networks. Developers can create neural nets with the Neuroph GUI. The Neuroph API documentation also explains how neural networks work.

### MXNet

[Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/api) has a [Java API](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Java+Inference+API) as well as many other bindings. It is backed by Carnegie Mellon and Amazon as well as the Apache Foundation.

### Deep Java Library (DJL)

[Deep Java Library](https://djl.ai/) is another Java-focused deep learning dev tool [introduced by Amazon](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-deep-java-library-djl-9de98de8c6ca).

Its users are industrial engineers and simulation modelers. Pathmind is being used by simulation modelers at Accenture and other global engineering teams to optimize in use cases like reducing carbon emissions in supply chain throughput, coordinating the activity of AGVs and cranes. It augments the control systems of organizations that have physical operations like factories, mines and warehouses. It helps them increase the efficiency and throughput of their operations by as much as 30%.

An expert system usually comprises hundreds or thousands of nested if-then statements. Expert systems were a popular form of AI in the 1980s. They are good at modeling static and deterministic relationships; e.g. the tax code. However, they are also brittle and they require manual modification, which can be slow and expensive. Unlike, machine-learning algorithms, they do not adapt as they are exposed to more data. They can be a useful complement to a machine-learning algorithm, codifying the things that should always happen a certain way.

This article lists ten popular Java AI frameworks, most of them open source. The choice of a framework mainly depends upon the support for algorithms and implementation of neural networks. Speed, dataset size, and ease of use are other factors that often affect decision making. What’s most important when choosing a Java machine learning library is to understand your project requirements and the problems you intend to solve.

For example, MALLET supports statistical natural language processing and is useful for analyzing massive collections of text. RapidMiner provides data handling, visualization, and modeling with machine learning algorithms. Its products are used by 450,000+ professionals to drive revenue, reduce costs, and avoid risks.

JSAT is arguably one of the fastest Java machine learning libraries. It provides high performance, flexibility, and opportunity for quickly getting started with ML problems. Apache Spark’s MLib is also known to be powerful and fast when it comes to the processing of large-scale data. Deeplearning4j is considered one of the best because it takes advantage of the latest distributed computing frameworks to accelerate training. Mahout offers high performance, flexibility, and scalability.
